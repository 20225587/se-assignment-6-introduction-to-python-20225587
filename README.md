# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Key features that make Python popular include:

Readability: Python's syntax is clear and easy to read, making it accessible to beginners and experienced developers alike.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks, such as file I/O, system calls, and web development.
Dynamic Typing: Variables in Python are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare their type explicitly.
Interpreted Language: Python code is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier and faster.
Cross-Platform: Python is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Community and Ecosystem: Python has a large and active community, which has contributed to a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.
Automation and Scripting: Automate repetitive tasks.
Software Development: Build applications quickly and efficiently.
Scientific Computing: Libraries like SciPy and Matplotlib.
 



2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.


Installing Python on Windows:

Download the Installer: Go to the official Python website and download the Windows installer.
Run the Installer: Execute the downloaded installer. Ensure you check the "Add Python to PATH" option.
Customize Installation: Choose "Customize installation" if you want to select optional features and install location.
Complete Installation: Click "Install Now" and wait for the installation to complete.
Verify Installation:
Open Command Prompt and run:

sh

python --version
You should see the installed Python version.

Set Up a Virtual Environment:

Open Command Prompt.
Navigate to your project directory.
Run:
sh

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:
sh

venv\Scripts\activate

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.


   python

print("Hello, World!")
Explanation:

print(): This is a built-in function in Python used to output text to the console.
"Hello, World!": This is a string, a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.


Basic Data Types:

int: Integer, a whole number.
float: Floating-point number, a number with a decimal point.
str: String, a sequence of characters.
bool: Boolean, representing True or False.
list: Ordered, mutable collection of items.
tuple: Ordered, immutable collection of items.
dict: Dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs.
set: Unordered collection of unique items.
Script:

python
# Integer
a = 10
print(a, type(a))

# Float
b = 20.5
print(b, type(b))

# String
c = "Hello"
print(c, type(c))

# Boolean
d = True
print(d, type(d))

# List
e = [1, 2, 3]
print(e, type(e))

# Tuple
f = (4, 5, 6)
print(f, type(f))

# Dictionary
g = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(g, type(g))

# Set
h = {1, 2, 3}
print(h, type(h))

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.


Conditional Statements:
Conditional statements allow you to execute certain code blocks based on conditions.

Example of an if-else Statement:

python
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is not greater than 5")
Loops:
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Example of a for Loop:

python
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.


Functions:
Functions are blocks of reusable code that perform a specific task. They help in reducing code redundancy, improving modularity, and enhancing readability.

Function Example:

python

def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 5)
print(result)  # Output: 8

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.



Differences:

Lists: Ordered collections of items. Items are accessed by their position (index).
Dictionaries: Unordered collections of key-value pairs. Items are accessed by keys.
Script:

python
# List
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers)
numbers.append(6)  # Adding an item
print(numbers)
print(numbers[2])  # Accessing an item by index

# Dictionary
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
print(person)
person["location"] = "Wonderland"  # Adding a key-value pair
print(person)
print(person["name"])  # Accessing an item by key



8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Exception handling allows you to manage and respond to runtime errors, ensuring your program can handle unexpected events gracefully without crashing.

Example:

python

try:
    numerator = 10
    denominator = 0
    result = numerator / denominator
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Cannot divide by zero")
finally:
    print("Execution complete")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.


Modules:
Modules are files containing Python code that can define functions, classes, and variables. They help in organizing code into manageable sections.

Packages:
Packages are collections of modules organized in directories that provide a hierarchical namespace.

Example:

python
import math

# Using the math module
print(math.sqrt(16))  # Output: 4.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793



10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.


    Reading from a File:

python

# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a File:

python

# Writing to a file
lines = ["First line", "Second line", "Third line"]
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")

# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
